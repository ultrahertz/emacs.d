* My emacs configuration

** The first 95% 

 is shamelessly stolen from [[https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d][Steve Purcell's]] pretty kick-ass config.

** SLIME

 There's a few changes to init-slime.el

** CIDER

 A few extra options in the CIDER config, purely aesthetic.

** The rest

 Anything else should be in =~/.emacs.d/lisp/init-local.el=.
